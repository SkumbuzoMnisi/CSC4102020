    "Duckweed are floating aquatic plants which belong to the monocotyledon family $Lemnaceae$. The plants are one of the smallest and simplest flowering plants, and can be identified by plants egg-shaped frond which is a few millimeters in diameter and short roots that are less than 1 cm in length (Landesman, Parker & Fedler)\n",
    "\n",
    "The duckweed family reproduces asexually. This occurs by the branching and afterwards the fragmenation of the shoots into fronds forming daughter and granddaughter fronds. The rate at which this occurs depends on the (Lemon, Posluszny & Husband, 2000):\n",

    "Duckweed is seen as a potential source of protein  with the solr dried duckweed crude proteins ranging from 25.2% - 36.5% and the protein concentrate from 37.5% - 44.7%, this protein range was due to the fact that the duckweed was in a nutrient-rich aquatic environment. Consumers of duckweed include (Rusoff, Blakeney and Culley, 1980):\n",

    "Duckweed can aid in waste management as it absorbs nutrients and is quick to multiply itself. This plant seems to fit well in the *'big picture'* to move from using copious amount of fertilizer to no fertiliser. If the use of domestic wastewater is used to grow these plants then a great protein concentration will be available that can be used in agricultural fertilization and as animal feed (Oron, 1994)."

    "We wish to model the growth of duckweed plant. Due to most of the information being unknown, several assumptions have been made as to keep the model simple. Set-up of the model also needs be adaptable to try and closely match available growth data. This will be useful in predicting the a fairly accurate growth rate of duckweed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above that the plant growth depends on the environmental conditions. It is useful to consider in the process model the effects the temperature has on the growth of duckwweed as most literature has studied its effect. Initially, air humidity, temperature, light intensity effects have been ignored.  In reality environmental conditions  like temperature, humidity and light intensity will have an influence on plant growth. In literature these variables are controlled for. It is assumed that a desirable amount of light exposure was supplied to the plant. The temperature was assumed to be at room temperature (similar to laboratory conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "The last major condition that influences plant growth would be the availability of nutrients. These variables were allowed to vary to observe the rates at which the nutrients are absorbed. More should be done to account for saturation limits mentioned in reading. For example, the maximum amount of nutrients that the duckweed can absorb and the minimum concentration of nutrients that can be supply for plant growth to take place. An assumed biomass formula of _Lemna gibba_ (Verma, 2016) has been used."
